"""Calculating whether a value is greater than the average value of consecutive subsets of data of certain window size."""

find the average of subsets of window size, if value is greater return whatever

Given an array and an integer K, find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size k.
Examples :

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6}, K = 3 
Output: 3 3 4 5 5 5 6
Explanation: 
Maximum of 1, 2, 3 is 3
Maximum of 2, 3, 1 is 3
Maximum of 3, 1, 4 is 4
Maximum of 1, 4, 5 is 5
Maximum of 4, 5, 2 is 5 
Maximum of 5, 2, 3 is 5
Maximum of 2, 3, 6 is 6

Input: arr[] = {8, 5, 10, 7, 9, 4, 15, 12, 90, 13}, K = 4 
Output: 10 10 10 15 15 90 90
Explanation:
Maximum of first 4 elements is 10, similarly for next 4 
elements (i.e from index 1 to 4) is 10, So the sequence 
generated is 10 10 10 15 15 90 90
